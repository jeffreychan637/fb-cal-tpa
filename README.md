#Facebook Calendar - Wix Market Application

This app allows users to share public events they have created on Facebook with visitors to their website.

Visitors can view the event details as well as RVSP through their Facebook accounts. They can also contribute to the event wall on Facebook by posting through the app or simply liking the comments that are already there.
