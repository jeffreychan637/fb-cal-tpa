#Facebook Calendar - Wix Market Application

This Wix app allows users to share public events they have created on Facebook with visitors to their website.

Visitors can view the event details as well as RVSP through their Facebook accounts. They can also contribute to the event wall on Facebook by posting through the app or simply liking the comments that are already there.

Site owners can display their events using two different views - List and Month.

###List View:
- Events are simply listed with their dates/times on the right.

###Month View:
- Visitors are shown a current calendar and can click around to find events.
- Events are marked with a colored dot. Clicking on the day of an event provides a mini list view of that day's event.

###Modal:
- A modal appears when a user clicks on an events name.
- In the modal, the user (after granting permissions to their Facebook account) can do the typical things they would do if they were on an actual Facebook event page.
